# Pradeep Koulgi

I am an ecologist and conservation scientist in India. I like introducing data from diverse streams to issues and the science of conservation. In a previous life, I was an engineer.

Over the years I have been fortunate to get to work with a diverse set of conservation professionals, ranging from scientists in NGOs & research labs to science- & data-journalists and litigating lawyers.

I believe strongly in openness in the practice of science, in conservation science in particular. This is a home for some of my attempts at learning how to, and practicing, this openness in my work.
